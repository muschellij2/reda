# reda

## Overview

The R pacakge **reda** provides functions for

- simulating survival, recurrent event, and multiple event data from stochastic
  process point of view;
- exploring and modeling recurrent event data through the mean cumulative
  function (MCF) or also called the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative
  hazard rate function, and gamma frailty model with spline rate function;
- comparing two-sample recurrent event responses with the pseudo-score tests.
